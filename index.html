            <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Vets2PM seeks to expand its national footprint by expanding Master Project Leadership Workshop (MPLW) operations to Colorado Springs, establishing a dedicated operational presence in one of the largest military and veteran populations in the United States. Colorado’s military footprint—including Fort Carson, Peterson Space Force Base, Schriever Space Force Base, Buckley Space Force Base, and the U.S. Air Force Academy—produces 5,000–7,000 DD214s annually, a number projected to rise to approximately 7,500 by 2026.</p>
